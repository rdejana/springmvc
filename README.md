# springmvc

Based on the work of Teddy Smith @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U3qK-PTc80&list=PL82C6-O4XrHejlASdecIsroNEbZFYo_X1&index=18

The good
- decent, if slightly dated
- good refresher
- users springboot

Some issues I've seen
- controls for write/deletes are done at the UI...don't do this.
- no real error handling
- "HTTP" concepts are pushed into service layer
  - makes testing annoying...
